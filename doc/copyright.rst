      ABSTRACT = {We describe an open-source kPAL package that facilitates an
        alignment-free assessment of the quality and comparability of
        sequencing datasets by analyzing k-mer frequencies. We show that kPAL
        can detect technical artefacts such as high duplication rates, library
        chimeras, contamination and differences in library preparation
        protocols. kPAL also successfully captures the complexity and
        diversity of microbiomes and provides a powerful means to study
        changes in microbial communities. Together, these features make kPAL
        an attractive and broadly applicable tool to determine the quality and
        comparability of sequence libraries even in the absence of a reference
        sequence. kPAL is freely available at https://github.com/LUMC/kPAL
